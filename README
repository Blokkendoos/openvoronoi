The OpenVoronoi project aims to produce an algorithm for calculating
the 2D voronoi-diagram for point, line-segment, and circular-arc sites.
Currently point-sites work well and line-segment sites are being worked
on. The incremental topology-oriented algorithm is used 
(see References).

Voronoi diagrams are used for many purposes in computational geometry,
but the motivation for OpenVoronoi has mainly been 2D offset-generation
for cnc mill toolpath calcuations.

Build instructions
This project uses cmake, and can be built out-of-source:
$ mkdir bld
$ cd bld
$ cmake ..
$ make

Other voronoi-diagram codes
CGAL.
Boost/Sweepline. This was a Google Summer of Code 2010 project.
Boostcon video:
VRONI/Martin Held. This code is commercial and not available, as far as
we know.
