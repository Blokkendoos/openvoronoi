The OpenVoronoi project aims to produce an algorithm for calculating
the 2D voronoi-diagram for point, line-segment, and circular-arc sites.
Currently point-sites work well and line-segment sites are being worked
on. The incremental topology-oriented algorithm is used 
(see References).

Voronoi diagrams are used for many purposes in computational geometry,
but the motivation for OpenVoronoi has mainly been 2D offset-generation
for cnc mill toolpath calcuations.

Dependencies
git (required only for the version-string)
cmake
Boost graph library
Boost python (if python bindings are built)

"liqd-dev" on ubuntu. See "http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/

Build instructions
This project uses cmake, and can be built out-of-source:
$ mkdir bld
$ cd bld
$ cmake ..
$ make
